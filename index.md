# Description

The Southern Ocean Freshwater Input from Antarctica (SOFIA) Initiative aims
to improve our understanding of the simulated response to Antarctic freshwater
input, and in particular the model uncertainty. 

The initiative has developed an experimental protocol and is engaging with modelling
groups from around the world to run this common set of experiments using a variety
of coupled climate and ocean-only models. Data from this international multi-model
ensemble is [openly shared](./data-access.html) for analysis, and is being 
synthesized into a series of publications by SOFIA participants. 

The initiative was started by the 
[CliC/CLIVAR/SCAR Southern Ocean Regional Panel](https://www.clivar.org/clivar-panels/southern), 
is endorsed as a [CLIVAR task team](https://www.clivar.org/sofia), and is a 
registered [CMIP7 community MIP](https://wcrp-cmip.org/mips/#registered-mips).


# Organization

The SOFIA team is made up of a collection of about 40 interested scientists. We always welcome participation from additional members and models. 
The team has an active slack workspace, and **we meet on every second Tuesday of the month via Zoom at 20:00 (8 pm) UTC**. 
Get in touch for details: mail.sofiamip [at] gmail [dot] com !

# Protocol

The [SOFIA experiment protocol](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/16/7289/2023/) was published in Geophysical Model Development (GMD) in December 2023 and can be downloaded as [pdf document](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/16/7289/2023/gmd-16-7289-2023.pdf). 

See [SOFIAMIP for CMIP7](./cmip7-sofiamip.html) for more specific information on the updated protocols for CMIP7.
