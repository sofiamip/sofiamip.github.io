# SOFIA:

## News
- [April 2023] The SOFIA experiment protocol pre-print is live on [EGUsphere](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2023-198/)

# Description

The Southern Ocean Freshwater release model experiments Initiative (SOFIA) aims
to improve our understanding of the simulated response to Antarctic freshwater
input, and in particular the model uncertainty. 

The initiative has developed an experimental protocol and is engaging with modelling
groups from around the world to run this common set of experiments using a variety
of coupled climate and ocean-only models. Data from this international multi-model
ensemble is [openly shared](./data-access.html) for analysis, and is being 
synthesized into a series of publications by SOFIA participants. 


The initiative was started by the 
[CliC/CLIVAR/SCAR Southern Ocean Regional Panel](https://www.clivar.org/clivar-panels/southern).

# Organization

The SOFIA team is made up of a collection of about 20 interested scientists. We always welcome participation from additional members and models. 
The team has an active slack workspace, and we meet on every second Tuesday of the month via zoom at 12 pm UTC. Get in touch
for details!
