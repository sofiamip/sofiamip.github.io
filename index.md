# Description

The Southern Ocean Freshwater release model experiments Initiative (SOFIA) aims
to improve our understanding of the simulated response to Antarctic freshwater
input, and in particular the model uncertainty. 

The initiative is developing an experimental protocol and engaging with modelling
groups from around the world to run this common set of experiments using a variety
of coupled climate and ocean-only models.

Data from this international multi-model ensemble will be shared for analysis, and
synthesized into a series of publications. Further
information will be made available here as the
initiative progresses.


The initiative was started by the 
[CliC/CLIVAR/SCAR Southern Ocean Regional Panel](https://www.clivar.org/clivar-panels/southern).
