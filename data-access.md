SOFIA data access
=================

Data usage policy
------------------

Significant effort has been invested by the SOFIA team to design the experiments, the modellers to run the experiments, and by the project members to house the data in an open common archive. These efforts should be recognized by anyone intending to utilize the data. We request that the [experimental design paper](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/16/7289/2023/) should be cited whenever the SOFIA data is used in publication. We also request that users of the data contact us (mail.sofiamip [at] gmail [dot] com) for input on appropriate use of the data and attribution, as well as collaboration on addressing scientific questions, possibly including the data producers as co-authors where appropriate.

Common archive
--------------

A common archive of participating model data is being maintained. Each modelling group may in addition post data via their own channels. 

Downloads from the common archive are via:

- `ftp`: [ftp://ftp.cccma.ec.gc.ca/pub/CCCMA/SOFIA/](ftp://ftp.cccma.ec.gc.ca/pub/CCCMA/SOFIA/) 
- `http`: [http://crd-data-donnees-rdc.ec.gc.ca/CCCMA/SOFIA](http://crd-data-donnees-rdc.ec.gc.ca/CCCMA/SOFIA)

See the README files underneath each model for license considerations and links to upstream model data repositories (where available).

Also see the [List of know deficiencies](./data-deficiencies.html) in the data - and let us know if you find any others!

**Uploading data**  
Participating modelers please contact neil [dot] swart [at] ec.gc.ca for upload instructions to the common archive.

Other archives
--------------
Additional data may be provided by individual modeling groups. Please reach out to the contacts listed above. Some data is directly accessible through the following links:
